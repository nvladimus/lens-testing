# Contrast mapping method
 This is a collection of notebooks for testing field curvature and contrast of a detection objective using a Ronchi ruling.

The method of contrast mapping was developed by [N.Vladimirov](https://github.com/nvladimus) as a part of the [Benchtop mesoSPIM](https://github.com/mesoSPIM/benchtop-hardware) project.
