# Contrast mapping method
 This is a collection of notebooks for **contrast mepping** method that allows low-cost testing of field curvature and contrast of a detection objective using a Ronchi ruling, a high-frequency slide containing black and transparent lines of speficif frequency (e.g. 40 line paris/mm).

 Depending on your needs, the Ronchi ruling can be in the air (for air objectives), or immersed into an imaging medium (for immersion objectives). For our specific needs, we test **air** objectives as they image through about 20 mm of high-index medium (cleared tissues, n1.52), so we immerse the Ronchi in a chamber with oil:

We are interested in field flatness, image contrast, and vignetting at the image corners, especially for CMOS camers with relatively large sensors (25 mm and higher), so that we can select the most suitable long-WD air objectives for our custom-built light-sheet microscopes.

The method of contrast mapping was developed by [N.Vladimirov](https://github.com/nvladimus) as a part of the [Benchtop mesoSPIM](https://github.com/mesoSPIM/benchtop-hardware) project.
